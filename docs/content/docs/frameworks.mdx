# Frameworks

antstack-js supports multiple HTTP frameworks, each with its own strengths. Choose the one that best fits your team's preferences and project requirements.

## Express

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is the classic Node.js framework—battle-tested, flexible, and widely adopted.

**Best for**:
- Teams familiar with the Express ecosystem
- Projects requiring extensive middleware options
- Legacy system integration

```bash
npx antstack-js@latest my-app --framework express
```

### Sample Route (Express)

```typescript
import { Router } from 'express';
import { UserController } from '../controllers/user.controller';

const router = Router();
const userController = new UserController();

router.get('/users/:id', userController.getUser);

export default router;
```

## Hono

[Hono](https://hono.dev/) is an ultrafast, lightweight framework built for the edge. It's modern, TypeScript-first, and incredibly fast.

**Best for**:
- Edge deployments (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge)
- High-performance APIs
- Teams who prefer modern, minimal APIs

```bash
npx antstack-js@latest my-app --framework hono
```

### Sample Route (Hono)

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { UserController } from '../controllers/user.controller';

const app = new Hono();
const userController = new UserController();

app.get('/users/:id', userController.getUser);

export default app;
```

## Fastify

[Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) is a performance-focused framework with built-in schema validation and plugin architecture.

**Best for**:
- High-throughput applications
- Teams who value built-in validation
- Plugin-based architectures

```bash
npx antstack-js@latest my-app --framework fastify
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Fastify support is coming soon. Currently, Express and Hono are fully supported.
