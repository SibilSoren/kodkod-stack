# Introduction

Welcome to **antstack-js**, a production-ready backend boilerplate generator inspired by ShadCN.

## Why antstack-js?

Setting up a modern backend is time-consuming. You have to choose a framework, configure an ORM, set up TypeScript, and then worry about structuring your code for scale. 

`antstack-js` provides a "Code-First" approach where you own every line of code generated. No framework lock-in, just modern best practices scaffolded in seconds.

## Quick Start

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx antstack-js
```

Then follow the interactive prompts to select your runtime, framework, database, and ORM.

## Features

- **Standard Layout**: Implements the Service-Controller-Repository pattern.
- **Middleware**: Built-in support for Auth, Logging, and Error Handling.
- **Typesafe**: First-class TypeScript support with strict mode by default.
- **Flexible**: Choose between Express, Hono, or Fastify.
